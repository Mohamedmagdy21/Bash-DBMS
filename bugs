in 
echo "--- Existing Databases ---"
    echo "Enter table you wish to list: "

why are we listing only one table and not all of them like i did in table_list.sh



in insertion, if i write string and some numbers it says wrong, i believe this should be okay and we did it in the lab



enter return to continue, if i enter anything it will continue


do you wish to continue(y/n) should be the same across all scripts
