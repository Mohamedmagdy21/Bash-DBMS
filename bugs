if i enter wrong column name or table name, it breaks out of the script and i have to enter number 5 again to return to it
i believe the solution is to make it "continue" instead of "break", but you must remove the clear command at the start


i tried make it continue, but there is an issue:
i think the whole logic should be wrapped inside a while because if i enter wrong column name, table name,etc
it goes to the next entry anyway
eg.
This your 1 entry
-----------------------------------------------
Enter table's name : 
 
dsfgdsfg
No table was found.
This your 2 entry
-----------------------------------------------
Enter table's name : 
 
bxvcbxcvbxcvb
No table was found.
This your 3 entry
: DONE



very minor note: when printing a column, it looks like this
enter the name of the column you wish to select:
name
name
sherif
NULL
ahmed
gemy123

maybe add column number to it and a border at the start ?








--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
new bugs, this is for you and me, read the first number and yours are numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, in number 4, make sure that dot couldn't be written in your files (data_select,data_insert,table_drop) and i will do the same in my files

1-in connect_table, it is very annoying having to enter a choice everytime , so i reverted it back to press anything to continue

2-miss checking if table exists in table_drop.sh


3-in insert, entering wrong table name results in error
Enter table you wish to insert in: 
1
ls: cannot access './databases/student/1': No such file or directory
No table was found.

4- we need to handle .meta file insertion by specifiying there is no dots exists in entering names, happened in insert
Enter table you wish to insert in: 
zxcv.meta
grep: ./databases/student/zxcv.meta.meta: No such file or directory
Column Number: 0
sed: -e expression #1, char 2: : doesn't want any addresses
⚠️ ERROR at line 86: sed -i "${firstEmpty}s/^$/$row/" "./databases/$DBName/$table"

5-in table_drop
if [ $intent == "yes" ]; then
		rm databases/$DBName/$table_name
        rm databases/$DBName/$table_name.meta
		break
    else
        # exit the code
        break
if you don't type yes it gets this error,
Are you sure you want to remove this table ?
./functions/table_drop.sh: line 23: [: ==: unary operator expected
maybe its best to make yes or no like other scripts ?


6-in data_update.sh and data_delete.sh , check for column exists or not before reading it's datatype


7- in create_table, if you only enter one column, it generates an error as code logic expects more than one

8-in data_delete, check if primary key exists or no

9- in data_delete, if there is more than on NULL primary key, all logic collapse, make sure if user choose primary key to be deleted , entire row gets deleted

10- in zenity, add a check to see if table is empty or not in select, update and delete
