if i enter wrong column name or table name, it breaks out of the script and i have to enter number 5 again to return to it
i believe the solution is to make it "continue" instead of "break", but you must remove the clear command at the start


i tried make it continue, but there is an issue:
i think the whole logic should be wrapped inside a while because if i enter wrong column name, table name,etc
it goes to the next entry anyway
eg.
This your 1 entry
-----------------------------------------------
Enter table's name : 
 
dsfgdsfg
No table was found.
This your 2 entry
-----------------------------------------------
Enter table's name : 
 
bxvcbxcvbxcvb
No table was found.
This your 3 entry




very minor note: when printing a column, it looks like this
enter the name of the column you wish to select:
name
name
sherif
NULL
ahmed
gemy123

maybe add column number to it and a border at the start ?
